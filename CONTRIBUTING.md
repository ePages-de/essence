# Contributing to Beyond Essence

We love pull requests from everyone. Here are some ways you can contribute:

* By using alpha, beta, and prerelease versions
* By reporting bugs
* By suggesting new features
* By writing or editing documentation
* By writing specifications
* By writing code (**no patch is too small**: fix typos, add comments, etc.)
* By refactoring code
* By closing [issues][]
* By reviewing patches

## Submitting an Issue

* We use the [GitHub issue tracker][issues] to track bugs and features.
* Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it
  hasn't already been submitted.
* When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist][gist] that includes a
  stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug,
  including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system. Ideally, a bug
  report should include a pull request with failing specs.

## Cleaning up issues

* Issues that have no response from the submitter will be closed after 30 days.
* Issues will be closed once they're assumed to be fixed or answered. If the
  maintainer is wrong, it can be opened again.
* If your issue is closed by mistake, please understand and explain the issue.
  We will happily reopen the issue.
